Check for NULL bound_offsets attribute!!!

Documentation Updates Needed:
==============================================

	Yes, I remember something like this; I think the doxygen documentation should be updated to emphasize what "sample" means, because it is not very clear.

==============================================
Updates needed:
==============================================

For Archive implementation:

    Need DATASTREAM_DATA_INPUT and DATASTREAM_DATA_OUTPUT environment
    variables that trump the DATASTREAM_DATA environment variable.

    Need a way to specify that all input files are in one directory and
    all ouput files should go to another single output directory.
    (i.e. a "flattened" directory structure mode).

Misc:

    Need to add an "update static data" option for variables similar to
    how the "exclude from metadata checks" works.

Needed for marinemet (let Yan know when done):
    Expose  _dsproc_get_reprocessing_mode to public.
    Added ability for users to added command line switches and comments.

Quicklooks:
  - need a quicklooks hook and options to only run, or not to run quicklooks.

Units:
  - need to implement a way to rename units that can not be handled by UDUNITS
    to units that can. This needs to happen as data is read in and before it
    is converted to user specified units. (i.e. 'km above MSL' -> 'km').

Retriever:
  - needs update to always set the time dimension to unlimited.
  - read in mapped coordinate variables that would not be loaded otherwise.

QC:
  - need to apply user defined QC after data is retrieved but before it is transformed.

Transform:
  - need a way for users to set transformation parameters from their code.
  - need multiple observation support

Merge Obs:
  - needs update to handle overlapping observations

Data Mapping:
  - needs update to map qc bits using bit_descriptions

==============================================
Misc Notes For Later:
==============================================

Database Updates Needed:

 - Add "data_format" to datastream_config (i.e. NetCDF, RAW, PNG, etc...)
 - Add "split_interval" to datastream_config

 - Move "file_patterns" from process_config to datastream config.

Misc:

 - Add better error checking for dataset dumps:

      dsproc_print.c:168              Creating dataset dump file:
                                       - dataset: /retrieved_data
                                       - file:
      ./debug_dumps/sgpklg_kazrC1.20110525.000000.post_retrieval.debug
      Filesize limit exceeded
